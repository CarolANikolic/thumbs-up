## A Product Recomendation Form

Thumbs-up is a short product recomendation form that allows you to write a product review. The input fields are validated using "regex" and the method match(). Once the form is validated and sent, it displays a confirmation that the review was sent successfully. 

The intention of this projected was to test my skills in HTML, CSS and JS.
